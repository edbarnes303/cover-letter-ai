## Cover Letter

### Salutation

Dear Brownbook Hiring Team!

### Body

I am writing to apply for the Staff Software Engineer role at Brownbook. I have deep experience building and scaling cloud products in small, fast-moving teams, translating complex operational workflows into reliable software, and leading multi-engineer initiatives from concept through production support.

Most recently, as a Principal Engineer at Anuvi, I helped take a process that was often done with paper or spreadsheets and deliver it as a SaaS product. I owned all parts of the architecture and implementation across APIs, data modeling, and integrations, partnering closely with product and operations to turn messy real-world requirements into maintainable systems. This included building rules-driven services, integrating with external partners via event driven pipelines, and implementing monitoring to quickly detect and resolve production issues.

Previously, as an Architect and Principal Engineer at Guild Education, I built APIs and microservices at scale and led platform efforts that improved developer velocity and reliability across multiple teams. A key part of that work was building out CI/CD pipelines that leveraged automated testing (unit, functional, and integration) with promotion and rollback workflows, raising confidence in releases while keeping quality high. Across these roles, I have strong proficiency with SQL and extensive experience designing and operating systems backed by relational databases, including performance-aware querying and data modeling for business-critical workflows.

Brownbook's focus on modernizing essential, operationally complex workflows, while keeping a high bar for quality in a small senior team, is exactly the environment where I do my best work. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my architecture, delivery, and production ownership experience can help Brownbook scale as you onboard new customers and expand integrations.

Sincerely,  
Ed Barnes
