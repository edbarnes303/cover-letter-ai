## Experience

### Staff Engineer, Intelligems

**Denver, CO — 2025 - 2026**

As a Staff Engineer at Intelligems, I drove full-stack feature development and architecture using a modern serverless stack. I focused on building scalable backend systems using TypeScript and the SST framework to deploy infrastructure and application logic directly to AWS Lambda. In addition to feature work, I served as a technical escalation point for customer inquiries, maintaining and optimizing the company’s TypeScript-based Shopify plugin to ensure reliability for merchants.

#### Accomplishments

- Designed and implemented core product features using TypeScript within a fully serverless architecture managed by SST.
- Diagnosed and resolved complex customer-facing issues within the Shopify plugin ecosystem, debugging TypeScript code to ensure seamless merchant integrations.
- Transformed internal APIs into a versioned, externally-consumable API, introducing stronger contracts and backwards-compatibility guarantees for customer integrations.
- Built an initial CI/CD framework by introducing GitHub Actions for pull-request validation, adding integration test suite, and structuring the pipeline to support future automated testing and deployments, improving release reliability and developer confidence.
