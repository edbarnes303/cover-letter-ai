## Cover Letter

### Salutation

Dear VemnuRX Hiring Team,

### Body

I am writing to apply for the Solution Architect role at VemnuRX. Your mission to support community health providers through secure, scalable technology strongly aligns with my experience building healthcare-adjacent systems in regulated environments.

At Anuvi, a Third-Party Administrator (TPA) in the healthcare benefits space, I served as a Principal Engineer designing and integrating systems that handled surface-level health insurance and eligibility data subject to HIPAA requirements. This work required careful attention to data privacy, secure integrations, and compliance, while still enabling rapid iteration in a fast-growing company. I regularly partnered with business and operations teams to translate complex requirements into practical architectures and to make thoughtful build-vs-buy decisions.

More broadly, I have extensive experience designing cloud-based, API-driven systems on AWS and acting as a bridge between business stakeholders and engineering teams. I am comfortable owning architectural decisions, evaluating third-party solutions, and advising leadership on trade-offs around scalability, security, and long-term maintainability.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background could support VemnuRX's mission.

### Signature

Sincerely,  
Ed Barnes
