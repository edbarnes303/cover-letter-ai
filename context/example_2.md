### Salutation

Dear ACME Healthcare Hiring Team,

### Body

I am writing to apply for the Senior Software Engineer role at ACME Healthcare. My background is centered on building production grade backend systems in Python, with a strong focus on API design, data workflows, and operating reliable services in AWS backed environments.

Across staff and principal engineering roles, I have designed, implemented, and maintained core backend services that support business critical workflows. I have extensive hands-on experience with Python in production, building RESTful APIs, integrating with PostgreSQL, S3, and NoSQL datastores, and managing infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code. I am comfortable owning systems end to end from architecture and implementation through testing, deployment, and observability and have regularly used tools like Datadog to ensure system health and performance.

I have worked closely with product managers, internal teams, and external stakeholders to translate product needs into well structured technical solutions, and I place a high value on clear documentation, diagrams, and design artifacts to support shared understanding. I also enjoy mentoring junior engineers and setting a high bar for code quality through thoughtful reviews and strong engineering standards.

ACME Healthcare’s mission driven work, emphasis on quality, and focus on well documented, maintainable systems strongly align with how I approach software engineering. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my backend and cloud experience to a team building products with meaningful impact in healthcare.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Ed Barnes
