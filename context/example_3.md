### Salutation

Dear Savant Hiring Team,

### Body

I am writing to apply for the Senior Software Engineer role at Savant. Your mission to make health data secure, accessible, and actionable strongly aligns with my background building cloud-native platforms and distributed systems where reliability, privacy, and operational discipline are non-negotiable.

Across principal and staff engineering roles, I have led architecture and end-to-end delivery for microservice and serverless systems on AWS, with deep hands-on experience in Python, TypeScript, and Java. At Anuvi, I owned core platform architecture including VPC design, relational database infrastructure, API design, and partner data pipelines using AWS services such as Lambda, SQS, S3, RDS/Aurora, and API Gateway. I also built rules-driven APIs to enforce complex compliance requirements, plus monitoring and error-tracking systems to improve reliability and reduce operational risk.

Previously at Guild Education, I helped scale a rapidly growing engineering organization by building serverless applications and CI/CD infrastructure used across multiple teams, including automated testing and promotion and rollback workflows. I also created frameworks that enabled teams to safely and consistently deploy GraphQL and REST endpoints, improving developer velocity while maintaining strong standards for quality and maintainability. Most recently, I delivered core product features in a fully serverless TypeScript stack, strengthened external API contracts through versioning and backwards compatibility, and served as an escalation point for customer-impacting issues.

Savant's focus on scalable microservices, observability, and secure data systems is a strong match for how I operate. I would welcome the opportunity to help drive major initiatives, partner closely with Infrastructure and Security, and mentor engineers while raising the bar on reliability and platform consistency.

Sincerely,  
Ed Barnes
