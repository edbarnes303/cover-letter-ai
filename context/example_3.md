### Salutation

Dear Inview Hiring Team,

### Body

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineering role at Inview. I bring over twenty years of experience building scalable distributed systems, with deep specialization in AWS, serverless architecture, and cloud-native platforms.

Currently, as Staff Engineer at Intelligems, I design and deliver core product features using a modern TypeScript serverless stack on AWS, architect APIs and infrastructure with SST, and serve as a technical escalation point for critical customer integrations. Previously, as Principal Engineer at Anuvi and Architect / Principal Engineer at Guild Education, I led the design of cloud platforms, introduced company-wide serverless architecture, built CI/CD systems used across dozens of teams, and created frameworks that automatically provisioned GraphQL and REST infrastructure—dramatically improving developer velocity and reliability.

What interests me about Inview is the opportunity to work on technically complex systems where correctness, performance, and reliability directly matter. I am most effective in environments that value strong engineering fundamentals, thoughtful architecture, and building platforms that enable teams to move quickly without sacrificing quality.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring that approach to Inview’s engineering team.

### Signature

Sincerely,  
Ed Barnes
